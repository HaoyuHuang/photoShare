photoShare
==========

an android-based social network system

The project aims at building a social network system, emphasizing on sharing photos. 

At this time, the project has implemented basic social network features such as posting photos, putting comments 
and following users, etc. The client side is built on android and the server side is based on J2EE, using Spring, 
Struts and Hibernate frameworks. 

While implementing the project, our team applied various design patterns on the either the client side and server side. 
The design pattern included Builder, Singleton, Decorator, Command, Observor, Strategy, Factory, Chain-of-Responsibilities 
and Template Method Pattern as illustrated in "Design Pattern: Elements of Resuable Object-Oriented Software",
"Pattern Hatching" and "Effective Java". 

The photoShare project is the client, the photoShareServer is the source code of the server  side and AuthService, 
QuartzService are two Web Services implemented by AXIS2 which is responsible for Authentication & Authorization and 
Job Schedule, respectively. 

The project is still in improving and built for National Undergraduate Innovative Training Program at Hohai University.
